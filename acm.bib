abstract = {This study investigates the effectiveness of quantum methods in tackling the cubic knapsack problem (CKP). The CKP is not only NP-hard but also extremely difficult to solve in practice. Benchmark instances of small size (including some with only 60 items) remain unsolved to proven optimality. We solve the CKP using the latest Digital Annealer (DA) prototype, an extended Ising machine available through the Quantum-Inspired Integrated Optimization (QIIO) service on Fujitsu's Kozuchi platform. Specifically, we propose two formulations: a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) and a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization. The latter is derived by reformulating the HUBO model into an equivalent quadratic form. These models are solved using the QIIO solver and compared with three state-of-the-art algorithms, a greedy heuristic, and two mixed integer programs. Additionally, we introduce a postprocessing heuristic to ensure the feasibility of solutions generated by the DA solver, as within short time limits, it does not always produce feasible solutions. Computational experiments are conducted on instances with up to 200 items and varying densities of nonzero objective coefficients. The results indicate that the HUBO formulation is highly competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving the best new solutions for six large instances.},

We investigate different QUBO formulations for the encoding of integers into Booleans and for the encoding of the At-Most-One constraint, which is used in combinatorial problems requiring capacity constraints. We compare four different QUBO models and report experiments done on the D-Wave annealing computer and the "quantum-inspired" Fixstars Amplify Annealing Engine. For this, we consider a simple example taken from the domain of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP), the N-queens problem, as its formulation involves multiple instances of the At-Most-One constraints.},

abstract = {The advancement of satellite-based quantum networks shows promise in transforming global communication infrastructure by establishing a secure and reliable quantum Internet. These networks use optical signals from satellites to ground stations to distribute high-fidelity quantum entanglements over long distances, overcoming the limitations of traditional terrestrial systems. However, the complexity of satellite-based entanglement distribution and terrestrial quantum swapping in the integrated network requires joint optimization with satellite assignment, resource allocation, and path selection. To address this challenge, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to solve the optimization problem by leveraging the strengths of both quantum and classical computing. The original problem is decomposed into a master problem and several subproblems using Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition and linearization techniques. Through experiments, this study demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed methods in optimizing large-scale networks and managing qubit usage compared to the classical optimization techniques. The findings provide valuable insights for designing and implementing satellite-based entanglement distribution in quantum networks, paving the way for a secure global quantum communication infrastructure.},

abstract = {Despite quantum computing is revealing an increasingly promising technology that has the potential to introduce a significant speed-up in many areas of computation, the number of problems that it can represent and solve is currently rather limited. Therefore, one of the current challenges faced by the quantum computing community is to broaden the class of problems that can be tackled. Among these problems, scheduling problems are a class of particularly interesting and hard combinatorial problems; in this paper, we present a novel solution for representing and solving the Flexible Open Shop Scheduling Problem (FOSSP) to optimality by minimizing the makespan. We firstly present a compact formulation of this problem as a Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), which can be used to solve this problem with a quantum annealer. Then, we proceed to the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) problem formulation, thus producing both the cost and mix Hamiltonians related to the problem. From the Hamiltonians, we provide the complete description of the quantum circuit that can be used to tackle the FOSSP within the QAOA framework. This second approach can be used to solve the optimization problem with a general-purpose quantum gate-based hardware.},

abstract = {Precision agriculture is essential for social good, global economy and food security, yet insect pests threaten productivity through crop damage, pathogen spread, and rising pest control costs. The overuse of pesticides leads to environmental issues and pesticide resistance. Advanced technologies like Visual Question Answering (VQA) provide solutions by integrating image processing with natural language understanding, facilitating efficient pest detection and crop health monitoring. While datasets like IP102 have enhanced pest recognition, they lack necessary question-answer pairs for VQA tasks in agriculture. To address this gap, we introduce the Insect Pest Visual Question Answering (IP-VQA) dataset, designed specifically for precision agricultural applications. This dataset includes a diverse collection of high-quality images annotated with detailed question-answer pairs related to crop health, pest identification, and agricultural practices. Our thorough data collection ensures reliability and relevance. We also utilize advanced multimodal large language models to set a benchmark for the dataset. The primary contribution of the IP-VQA dataset lies in its comprehensive coverage and VQA integration within agricultural contexts. By providing rich visual and textual information, it connects VQA techniques to practical agricultural needs, supporting ongoing research and paving the way for future studies in precision agriculture.},

abstract = {We present Quantum Belief Propagation (QBP), a Quantum Annealing (QA) based decoder design for Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) error control codes, which have found many useful applications in Wi-Fi, satellite communications, mobile cellular systems, and data storage systems. QBP reduces the LDPC decoding to a discrete optimization problem, then embeds that reduced design onto quantum annealing hardware. QBP's embedding design can support LDPC codes of block length up to 420 bits on real state-of-the-art QA hardware with 2,048 qubits. We evaluate performance on real quantum annealer hardware, performing sensitivity analyses on a variety of parameter settings. Our design achieves a bit error rate of 10--8 in 20 μs and a 1,500 byte frame error rate of 10--6 in 50 μs at SNR 9 dB over a Gaussian noise wireless channel. Further experiments measure performance over real-world wireless channels, requiring 30 μs to achieve a 1,500 byte 99.99% frame delivery rate at SNR 15-20 dB. QBP achieves a performance improvement over an FPGA based soft belief propagation LDPC decoder, by reaching a bit error rate of 10--8 and a frame error rate of 10--6 at an SNR 2.5--3.5 dB lower. In terms of limitations, QBP currently cannot realize practical protocol-sized (e.g., Wi-Fi, WiMax) LDPC codes on current QA processors. Our further studies in this work present future cost, throughput, and QA hardware trend considerations.},

Optimizing resource usage in the cloud infrastructure is quite challenging. We propose a framework that utilizes Prediction and Monitoring techniques to detect fault and optimize the resource allocation and reduces the downtimes. By employing machine learning algorithms to scrutinise performance data from the past, the framework is able to anticipate fault events before they happen. Besides, this prediction ability takes action at the right moment to improve the operational reliability. A recursive is also built-in, allowing the model to improve performance continuously, based on real-time insights from cloud operations. From the experiments conducted in different cloud environments, considerable enhancements have been obtained in fault detection rates and resource utilization efficiency as compared to those in existing approaches thus highlighting the importance of predictive analytics in building robust open cloud infrastructure.},

However, research on UAVs is not going on as quickly as the technology. Especially, when it comes to the security of these devices, the academia is lagging behind the industry. This gap motivates our work in this article as a stepping stone for future research in this area. A comprehensive survey on the security of UAVs and UAV-based systems can help the research community keep pace with, or even lead the industry. Although there are several reviews on UAVs or related areas, there is no recent survey broadly covering various aspects of security. Moreover, none of the existing surveys highlights current and future trends with a focus on the role of an omnipresent technology such as AI. This article endeavors to overcome these shortcomings. We conduct a comprehensive review on security challenges of UAVs as well as the related security controls. Then we develop a future roadmap for research in this area with a focus on the role of AI. The future roadmap is established based on the identified current trends, under-researched topics, and a future look-ahead.},

abstract = {Quantum computing addresses the construction and operation of quantum computers to solve more efficiently instances of specific problems that are difficult to tackle with classical computers. Even if we are currently in the so-called Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ), steady signs of progress are being made towards the realization of a fast and reliable quantum computer, materializing the basic building blocks of quantum circuits, i.e., quantum bits and gates. On the other hand, quantum communications cover the transmission of quantum states across distances. Recent advances in this context have led to the novel research area of quantum networking, which is set to define the programming interfaces and protocols for the practical operation of quantum communication and computing infrastructures. The tutorial has the objective of raising awareness about these emerging topics, i.e., quantum computing and quantum networking, in the research community by i) introducing briefly the latest technologies developed in each, then ii) providing hands-on examples of how to use them for simple use cases, and iii) finally sketching the more promising open research challenges.},

abstract = {Welcome to the second volume of ASPLOS'24: the 29th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems. This document is dedicated to the 2024 summer review cycle.We introduced several notable changes to ASPLOS this year, many of which were discussed in the previous message from program chairs in Volume 1. Here, to avoid repetition, we assume that readers have already read the latter message and will only describe differences between the current cycle and the previous one. These include: (1) developing and utilizing an automated format violation identifier script focused on uncovering disallowed vertical space manipulations that "squeeze" space; (2) incorporating authors-declared best-matching topics into our review assignment process; (3) introducing the new ASPLOS role of Program Vice Chairs to cope with the increased number of submissions and the added load caused by foregoing synchronous program committee (PC) meetings, which necessitated additional managerial involvement in online dissensions; and (4) characterizing a systematic problem that ASPLOS is facing in reviewing quantum computing submissions, describing how we addressed it, and highlighting how we believe that it should be handled in the future.Key statistics of the ASPLOS'24 summer cycle include: 409 submissions were finalized (about 1.5x more than last year's summer count and nearly 2.4x more than our spring cycle), with 107 related to accelerators/FPGAs/GPUs, 97 to machine learning, 88 to storage/memory, 80 to security, and 69 to datacenter/cloud; 179 (44%) submissions were promoted to the second review round; 54 (13.2%) papers were accepted (with 20 awarded one or more artifact evaluation badges); 33 (8.1%) submissions were allowed to submit major revisions, of which 27 were subsequently accepted during the fall cycle (with 13 awarded one or more artifact evaluation badges); 1,499 reviews were uploaded; and 5,557 comments were generated during online discussions.Analyzing the per-submission most-related broader areas of research, which we asked authors to associate with their work in the submission form, revealed that 71%, 47%, and 28% of the submissions are categorized by their authors as related to architecture, operating systems, and programming languages, respectively, with about 45% being "interdisciplinary" submissions (associated with more than one area).

abstract = {Kubernetes has emerged as a prominent open-source platform for managing cloud applications, including stateful databases. These monolithic applications rely on vertical scaling, adjusting CPU cores based on load fluctuations. However, our analysis of Kubernetes-based Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) offerings at Microsoft revealed that many customers consistently over-provision resources for peak workloads, neglecting cost-saving opportunities through resource scale-down. We found that there is a gap in the ability of existing vertical autoscaling tools to minimize resource slack and respond promptly to throttling, leading to increased costs and impacting crucial metrics such as throughput and availability.To address this challenge, we propose CaaSPER, a vertical autoscaling algorithm that blends reactive and proactive strategies. By dynamically adjusting CPU resources, CaaSPER minimizes resource slack, maintains optimal CPU utilization, and reduces throttling. Importantly, customers have the flexibility to prioritize either cost savings or high performance based on their preferences. Extensive testing demonstrates that CaaSPER effectively reduces throttling and keeps CPU utilization within target levels. CaaSPER is designed to be application-agnostic and platform-agnostic, with potential for extension to other applications requiring vertical autoscaling.},

abstract = {Recent progress in quantum algorithms and hardware indicates the potential importance of quantum computing in the near future. However, finding suitable application areas remains an active area of research. Quantum machine learning is touted as a potential approach to demonstrate quantum advantage within both the gate-model and the adiabatic schemes. For instance, the Quantum-assisted Variational Autoencoder (QVAE) has been proposed as a quantum enhancement to the discrete VAE. We extend on previous work and study the real-world applicability of a QVAE by presenting a proof-of-concept for similarity search in large-scale high-dimensional datasets. While exact and fast similarity search algorithms are available for low dimensional datasets, scaling to high-dimensional data is non-trivial. We show how to construct a space-efficient search index based on the latent space representation of a QVAE. Our experiments show a correlation between the Hamming distance in the embedded space and the Euclidean distance in the original space on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset.Further, we find real-world speedups compared to linear search and demonstrate memory-efficient scaling to half a billion data points.},

abstract = {We are delighted to introduce the first volume of the ASPLOS proceedings for 2025. The conference is in its third year of an experiment with a three-deadline structure: authors can submit to any of three separate review cycles handled by a single year-long program committee. This volume includes papers from the first two review cycles, which had submission deadlines in the spring and summer of 2024. We combined the two cycles because submission volumes in the spring cycle were disproportionately small.This volume contains 72 of the 74 papers accepted to ASPLOS 2025 to date. This includes papers accepted in the spring and summer cycles and those invited to submit a revision in the spring cycle that was ultimately accepted. Two of these 74 accepted papers are still undergoing artifact evaluation and will be published in a subsequent volume. The spring and summer review cycles saw a combined 586 submissions. These submissions were reviewed by a 208-person Program Committee augmented by 57 External Review Committee members. On occasion, we solicited a small number of external expert reviews. On the PC, 129 members self-reported they were in an academic role and 77 self-reported they were in an industrial role. On the ERC it was 43 and 13 respectively. The median PhD year of the combined committees was 2014. In addition to these committees, we engaged ten vice chairs, experienced and trusted reviewers who helped us monitor the review process for each paper.These committees reviewed all of the submissions that were not desk rejected (11 papers) or withdrawn (4 papers). In keeping with recent norms, the technical review happened in two phases. Each paper received three reviews in the first round, with, in most cases, two additional reviews in the second round for the 54% of submissions that advanced. To assign reviews, we used the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS) to provide a preliminary review assignment that matched reviewer expertise. We then manually inspected and adjusted these assignments as needed: for example, to correct errors in TPMS's topic modeling or adjust to late-discovered conflicts. In addition, each paper was assigned a non-conflicted chair and a non-conflicted vice chair to provide two extra sets of eyes to monitor and facilitate the process. Due to the size and distribution of the PC, which spanned 14 time zones, the PC did not meet synchronously. Instead, each paper was discussed by the reviewers via comments in the HotCRP system. Ultimately, the discussion for each paper reached one of three outcomes: rejection, conditional acceptance, or major revision. All conditionally accepted papers were shepherded. Major revision papers were invited to revise and resubmit their paper for a second round of review by a subset of the original reviewers. All authors of papers that advanced to the second round of review were given the opportunity to see and respond to their reviewer questions prior to the reviewer discussion.},

abstract = {We focus on domain and class generalization problems in analyzing optical remote sensing images, using the large-scale pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), CLIP. While contrastively trained VLMs show impressive zero-shot generalization performance, their effectiveness is limited when dealing with diverse domains during training and testing. Existing prompt learning techniques overlook the importance of incorporating domain and content information into the prompts, which results in a drop in performance while dealing with such multi-domain data. To address these challenges, we propose a solution that ensures domain-invariant prompt learning while enhancing the expressiveness of visual features. We observe that CLIP’s vision encoder struggles to identify contextual image information, particularly when image patches are jumbled up. This issue is especially severe in optical remote sensing images, where land-cover classes exhibit well-defined contextual appearances. To this end, we introduce C-SAW, a method that complements CLIP with a self-supervised loss in the visual space and a novel prompt learning technique that emphasizes both visual domain and content-specific features. We keep the CLIP backbone frozen and introduce a small set of projectors for both the CLIP encoders to train C-SAW contrastively. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of C-SAW across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and different generalization tasks.},

abstract = {Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a vital yet challenging task in the field of multimedia comprehension. In order to correctly answer questions about an image, a VQA model requires to sufficiently understand the visual scene, especially the vision-semantic reasonings between the two modalities. Traditional relation-based methods allow to encode the pairwise relations of objects to boost the VQA model performance. However, this simple strategy is deficient to exploit the abundant concepts expressed by the composition of diverse image objects, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a focal and composed vision-semantic modeling method, which is a trainable end-to-end model, for better vision-semantic redundancy removal and compositionality modeling. Concretely, we first introduce the LENA cell, a plug-and-play reasoning module, which removes redundant semantic by a focal mechanism in the first step, followed by the vision-semantic compositionality modeling for better visual reasoning. We then incorporate the cell into a full LENA network, which progressively refines multimodal composed representations, and can be leveraged to infer the high-order vision-semantic in a multi-step learning way. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., VQA v2 and VQA-CP v2, verify the superiority of our model as compared with several state-of-the-art baselines.},

abstract = {On behalf of the organizing committee, we are delighted to welcome you to the 34th ACM International Symposium on Physical Design (ISPD), held in Austin, Texas, providing a premier forum to exchange ideas, highlight key technology challenges, present leading-edge theoretical and experimental contributions, and identify future research directions in this field. We extend the good practice of having a YouTube channel to view the talks during the symposium and afterward, improving access to the presentations.Across three days, ISPD 2025 has 3 keynotes, 18 accepted papers, 13 invited talks; one panel on Monday with 4 panelists; and 4 speakers with longer talks in Professor Jason Cong''s commemorative session, and finally the ISPD 2025 contest results.This year, we received a total of 64 abstracts and we received 48 full manuscripts, from which 18 were selected - a 37.5% acceptance rate. The regular papers in the ISPD 2025 program were selected, after a rigorous month-long double-blind review process and virtual meetings, by the Technical Program Committee with 20 outstanding international professionals from both academia and industry. These papers exhibit the latest advancements in a variety of topics in physical design, including global placement; mixed cell-height legalization; PCB placement; inverse lithography; quantum layout; photonic integrated circuits and side channel analysis; timing propagation; logic optimization; crosstalk mitigation; DRC checking; gate sizing; standard cell layout; CFET cell design; timing rule generation; analog cell design; 3D net-to-pad assignment, and 3D power delivery. A number of these papers utilize advanced mathematical programming, satisfiability modulo theories, GPU acceleration, and machine learning techniques.We are delighted to host three distinguished keynote speakers. The Monday keynote "Towards Designing and Deploying Ising Machines" will be given by Professor Sachin Sapatnekar of the University of Minnesota. He will explore opportunities for solving complex combinatorial optimization problems using Ising machines. The discussion will emphasize the layout and timing challenges specific to Ising machines that are based on coupled CMOS ring oscillators. On Tuesday morning, Dr. Charles J Alpert of Cadence Design Systems will present "How Automotive Functional Safety is Disrupting Digital Implementation". He will provide an overview of the challenges in achieving functional-safe ICs for automotive applications and discuss their impact on the digital implementation flow, including synthesis, placement, and routing. Wednesday's keynote is given by Dr. Henry Sheng from Synopsys on "Automation and Optimization of Heterogeneous Systems". He will explore the challenges and strategies for automating heterogeneous integration, an area that has traditionally relied on disconnected workflows and significant manual effort.The ISPD 2025 program is complemented by invited talks on topics ranging across design technology co-optimization; systolic array-based ICs; ECO automation, ML &amp; AI methods in design automation; 3D IC design and integration; power design and analysis; and an analysis of the historical impact of ISPD. Additionally, we have a panel discussing EDA challenges in heterogeneous integration.In the ISPD Lifetime Achievement Award session on Tuesday, we will pay tribute to Professor Jason Cong. This session highlights Professor Cong's pioneering contributions in the algorithmic aspects of the physical design of silicon chips. This session has talks from his mentor, labmate and former students. Dr Bryan Preas will present the Innovation in Times of Technology Disruption. Followed by the talk from Professor Martin Wong from Hong Kong Baptist University. Professor David Pan, from University of Texas at Austin, will discuss the future of interconnected Physical Design. Finally, Professor Jason Cong will also grace the symposium with a delightful talk on coping with interconnects and a recount of his numerous contributions in EDA and Physical Design..Since 2005, ISPD has organized highly competitive contests to promote and advance research in placement, global routing, clock network synthesis, gate sizing, detailed routing-driven placement, and hardware security. The contest this year features the second contest on GPU-accelerated and machine learning-enhanced large scale global routing. This time the contest integrates timing and power metric. The contest is again organized by NVIDIA. The contest aims to not only deliver substantial reductions in global routing runtime but take performance and power into account as required in real-world applications. This year's contest attracted 46 teams from all over the world, reaching a record high.This year, we continue with a short format for the invited talks and regular papers. Presentations are 12 minutes in length, plus about 5 minutes for questions and answers after each talk, and some time at the end of each session for open discussion. This format is intended to encourage discussion among our research community. The talks in the lifetime achievement session are 20 minutes in length, with 5 minutes for questions and answers. Keynotes remain about 40 minutes in length, with 10 minutes for discussion.},

abstract = {Benefiting from the advancement of computer vision, natural language processing and information retrieval techniques, visual question answering (VQA), which aims to answer questions about an image or a video, has received lots of attentions over the past few years. Although some progress has been achieved so far, several studies have pointed out that current VQA models are heavily affected by the language prior problem, which means they tend to answer questions based on the co-occurrence patterns of question keywords (e.g., how many) and answers (e.g., 2) instead of understanding images and questions. Existing methods attempt to solve this problem by either balancing the biased datasets or forcing models to better understand images. However, only marginal effects and even performance deterioration are observed for the first and second solution, respectively. In addition, another important issue is the lack of measurement to quantitatively measure the extent of the language prior effect, which severely hinders the advancement of related techniques.In this paper, we make contributions to solve the above problems from two perspectives. Firstly, we design a metric to quantitatively measure the language prior effect of VQA models. The proposed metric has been demonstrated to be effective in our empirical studies. Secondly, we propose a regularization method (i.e., score regularization module) to enhance current VQA models by alleviating the language prior problem as well as boosting the backbone model performance. The proposed score regularization module adopts a pair-wise learning strategy, which makes the VQA models answer the question based on the reasoning of the image (upon this question) instead of basing on question-answer patterns observed in the biased training set. The score regularization module is flexible to be integrated into various VQA models. We conducted extensive experiments over two popular VQA datasets (i.e., VQA 1.0 and VQA 2.0) and integrated the score regularization module into three state-of-the-art VQA models. Experimental results show that the score regularization module can not only effectively reduce the language prior problem of these VQA models but also consistently improve their question answering accuracy.},

abstract = {While the concept of responsible AI is becoming more and more popular, practitioners and researchers may often struggle to characterize responsible practices in their own work. This paper presents a four-day, PhD-level course on Responsible Artificial Intelligence conducted at the University of Udine by Dr. Damiano Spina. Using a hands-on approach, the course aimed to illustrate the application of responsible AI concepts in research. Using case studies based on existing IR research, the course explored responsible AI concepts such as positionality, participatory research, fairness, diversity, and ethics. The course engaged 23 participants, both online and in person, including PhD students at various stages, postdoctoral researchers, professors, and academic staff. It featured four sessions and five interactive group activities. Of the 23 attendees, 20 (87%) actively participated in the activities, and 14 (61%) completed the final survey. We believe the hands-on activities discussed in this paper can assist practitioners and educators in the design of responsible AI content for information retrieval curriculum.Date: May 21--24, 2024.Website: https://www.damianospina.com/teaching/responsible-ai.},

abstract = {The Controller Area Network (CAN) is the most widely used in-vehicle communication protocol, which still lacks the implementation of suitable security mechanisms such as message authentication and encryption. This makes the CAN bus vulnerable to numerous cyber attacks. Various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been developed to detect these attacks. However, the high generalization capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) make AI-based IDS an excellent countermeasure against automotive cyber attacks. This article surveys AI-based in-vehicle IDS from 2016 to 2022 (August) with a novel taxonomy. It reviews the detection techniques, attack types, features, and benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the article discusses the security of AI models, necessary steps to develop AI-based IDSs in the CAN bus, identifies the limitations of existing proposals, and gives recommendations for future research directions.},

abstract = {Welcome to The ACM Web Conference 2025 (WWW'25), held from April 28 to May 2, 2025, at the Sydney Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre in Australia. Recognizing the breadth of this year's program, we are publishing two sets of proceedings: one dedicated to research track papers, the Web4Good track, and keynotes; and a companion proceedings featuring the Demo Paper Track, Short Paper Track, PhD Symposium, Special Day, Resource Track, and History of Web sessions. Through this rich assortment of activities, we aim to foster a vibrant community where delegates can share ideas, forge collaborations, and cultivate a sustainable, inclusive environment.Marking its 34th edition, WWW'25 welcomes more than 1,000 industry and academic experts eager to shape the future of Web technologies and applications. The conference logo, depicting the Sydney Harbour Bridge, symbolizes the Web's key function of "connecting" people and information. Originally founded at CERN in 1994 as the International World Wide Web Conference (WWW), this event has long been the leading venue for research, development, standards, and applications related to the Web.Over the years, WWW has introduced important breakthroughs, from The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Web Search Engine in 1998-which heralded Google-to the EigenTrust algorithm in 2003 and the YAGO knowledge base in 2007. In the period between 2024 and 2025, large language models (LLMs) have significantly influenced countless industries and everyday life, prompting fundamental shifts in the Web ecosystem. We anticipate that the research and discussions at this year's conference will spark further breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field.Continuing the tradition of depth and diversity, WWW'25 accepted 26 workshops and 20 tutorials as pre-conference events. In addition, consistent with previous editions, we feature a Demo Paper Track, Short Paper Track, PhD Symposium, Special Day, Resource Track, History of Web sessions, and Artifact Badging. Some of these are incorporated into the main conference schedule to encourage communication and collaboration among attendees.A commitment to diversity is pivotal to fostering robust, sustainable Web technologies. Our Web4Good track highlights how Web-based tools can address societal challenges, while the Industry Track showcases novel and impactful results from the industrial sector. This year, we have also launched an Emerging World Track to broaden participation from developing countries, as well as a competition track to enhance industry engagement..Organizing WWW'25 has been a true team effort. We sincerely thank the authors who contributed their work, and we extend our gratitude to the program and senior program committees for their dedication to reviewing submissions and offering feedback. We also appreciate the many additional chairs whose efforts ensured that each element of the program ran smoothly.

abstract = {Multimodal machine learning is a vibrant multi-disciplinary research field that aims to design computer agents with intelligent capabilities such as understanding, reasoning, and learning through integrating multiple communicative modalities, including linguistic, acoustic, visual, tactile, and physiological messages. With the recent interest in video understanding, embodied autonomous agents, text-to-image generation, and multisensor fusion in application domains such as healthcare and robotics, multimodal machine learning has brought unique computational and theoretical challenges to the machine learning community given the heterogeneity of data sources and the interconnections often found between modalities. However, the breadth of progress in multimodal research has made it difficult to identify the common themes and open questions in the field. By synthesizing a broad range of application domains and theoretical frameworks from both historical and recent perspectives, this article is designed to provide an overview of the computational and theoretical foundations of multimodal machine learning. We start by defining three key principles of modality heterogeneity, connections, and interactions that have driven subsequent innovations, and propose a taxonomy of six core technical challenges: representation, alignment, reasoning, generation, transference, and quantification covering historical and recent trends. Recent technical achievements will be presented through the lens of this taxonomy, allowing researchers to understand the similarities and differences across new approaches. We end by motivating several open problems for future research as identified by our taxonomy.},

abstract = {With the world population rapidly increasing, transforming our agrifood systems to be more productive, efficient, safe, and sustainable is crucial to mitigate potential food shortages. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as deep learning (DL) have demonstrated their strong abilities in various areas, including language, vision, remote sensing (RS), and agrifood systems applications. However, the overall impact of AI on agrifood systems remains unclear. In this article, we thoroughly review how AI techniques can transform agrifood systems and contribute to the modern agrifood industry. First, we summarize the data acquisition methods in agrifood systems, including acquisition, storage, and processing techniques. Second, we present a progress review of AI methods in agrifood systems, specifically in agriculture, animal husbandry, and fishery, covering topics such as agrifood classification, growth monitoring, yield prediction, and quality assessment. Furthermore, we highlight potential challenges and promising research opportunities for transforming modern agrifood systems with AI. We hope this survey can offer an overall picture to newcomers in the field and serve as a starting point for their further research.

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown significant potential in tourism, particularly in personalized recommendations, information provision, and user experience sharing. Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have further enhanced AI-driven solutions. Although some MLLMs for tourism are proposed, existing models are constrained to a narrow range of tasks, limiting their effectiveness in providing information and personalization. Additionally, while some instruction tuning methods are proposed, effective learning methods that facilitate scaling for multi-task learning are still lacking in this domain. This paper proposes TourMLLM, a multimodal large language model designed to expand task coverage while improving training efficiency and accuracy. TourMLLM supports six key tasks, broadening its applications: landmark recognition, general review generation, conditional review generation, tourism recommendation, tourism image captioning with and without landmark names. To enhance adaptability and performance, we introduce task-adaptive retrieval-augmented instruction tuning and preference optimization strategies, allowing the model to handle diverse tourism-related tasks more effectively. Evaluation across six tasks demonstrates that TourMLLM outperforms GPT-4o in accuracy. The dataset and code are available online at https://github.com/HiromasaYamanishi/TourMLLM.},

The Annual ACM International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval (ICMR) offers a great opportunity for exchanging leading-edge multimedia retrieval ideas among researchers, practitioners, and other potential users of multimedia retrieval systems. ACM ICMR was created in 2011 in a merger of ACM CIVR (International Conference on Image and Video Retrieval) and ACM MIR (International Conference on Multimedia Information Retrieval). ACM ICMR serves to illuminate the state of the art in multimedia retrieval. ACM ICMR 2024 in Phuket follows the successful previous editions of ICMR in Trento, Italy 2011; Hong Kong, China 2012; Dallas, USA 2013; Glasgow, UK 2014; Shanghai, China 2015; New York, USA 2016; Bucharest, Romania 2017; Yokohama, Japan 2018; Ottawa, Canada 2019; Dublin, Ireland 2020 (online); Taipei, Taiwan 2021 (online); Newark, USA 2022 (hybrid); and Thessaloniki, Greece 2023 (hybrid).},

abstract = {Attention learning for visual question answering remains a challenging task, where most existing methods treat the attention and the non-attention parts in isolation. In this paper, we propose to enforce the correlation between the attention and the non-attention parts as a constraint for attention learning. We first adopt an attention-guided erasing scheme to obtain the attention and the non-attention parts respectively, and then learn to separate the attention and the non-attention parts by an appropriate distance margin in a feature embedding space. Furthermore, we associate a typical classification loss with the above distance constraint to learn a more discriminative attention map for answer prediction. The proposed approach does not introduce extra model parameters or inference complexity, and can be combined with any attention-based models. Extensive ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, and new state-of-the-art or competitive results on four publicly available datasets are achieved.},

abstract = {Tables&nbsp;and figures are usually used to present information in a structured and visual way in scientific documents. Understanding the tables and figures in scientific documents is significant for a series of downstream tasks, such as academic search, scientific knowledge graphs, and so on. Existing studies mainly focus on detecting figures and tables from scientific documents, interpreting their semantics, and integrating them into downstream tasks. However, a systematic and comprehensive literature review on the mining and application of tables and figures in academic papers is still missing. In this article, we introduce the research framework and the whole pipeline for understanding tables and figures, including detection, structural analysis, interpretation, and application. We deliver a thorough analysis of benchmark datasets, recent techniques, and their pros and cons. Additionally, a quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of different models on popular benchmarks is presented. We further outline several important applications that exploit the semantics of scientific tables and figures. Finally, we highlight the challenges and some potential directions for future research. We believe this is the first comprehensive survey in understanding scientific tables and figures that covers the landscape from detection to application.},

abstract = {Semantic relationship information is important to the image-text retrieval task. Existing work usually extract relationship information by calculating the relationship value pairwise, which is hardly to find out a meaningful semantic relationship. A more reasonable method is to convert the modal to a scene graph, thereby explicitly modeling the relationship. Scene graph is a kind of graph data structure modeling the scene of modality. There are two concept in a scene graph, object and relationship. In image modal, object indicates the image region and relationship represents the predicate of the image regions. In text modal, object indicates the entity and relationship represents the association between entities, also known as semantic relationship. In image-text retrieval task, both object and relationship are important, and a key challenge is to obtain semantic information. In this paper, image and text are represented as two kinds of scene graphs: visual scene graph and textual scene graph, and then they are combined into Heterogeneous Scene Graph(HSG). By explicitly modeling relationships using directed graph, the information can be passed edge-wise. To further extract semantic information, we introduce the metapath, which can extract specific semantic information on specified path. Moreover, we propose Heterogeneous Message Passing(HMP) to communicate information on the metapath. After the message passing, the similarity of two modalities can be represented as the similarity of the graphs. Experiment shows that the model achieve competitive results on Flickr30K and MSCOCO, which indicates that our approach has advantages in image-text retrieval.},

Existing crop growth prediction models focus on one crop and train a single model for each crop. In this article, we develop a ubiquitous growth prediction model for multiple crops, aiming at training a single model for multiple crops. A ubiquitous vision and sensor transformer (ViST) model for crop growth prediction with image and sensor data is developed to achieve the goals. In the proposed model, a cross-attention mechanism is proposed to facilitate the fusion of multimodal feature maps to reduce computational costs and balance the interactive effects among features. To train the model, we combine the data from multiple crops to create a single (ViST) model. A sensor network system is established for data collection on the farm where rice, soybean, and maize are cultivated. Experimental results show that the proposed ViST model has an excellent ubiquitous ability for crop growth prediction with multiple crops.},

abstract = {Active learning (AL) attempts to maximize a model’s performance gain while annotating the fewest samples possible. Deep learning (DL) is greedy for data and requires a large amount of data supply to optimize a massive number of parameters if the model is to learn how to extract high-quality features. In recent years, due to the rapid development of internet technology, we have entered an era of information abundance characterized by massive amounts of available data. As a result, DL has attracted significant attention from researchers and has been rapidly developed. Compared with DL, however, researchers have a relatively low interest in AL. This is mainly because before the rise of DL, traditional machine learning requires relatively few labeled samples, meaning that early AL is rarely according the value it deserves. Although DL has made breakthroughs in various fields, most of this success is due to a large number of publicly available annotated datasets. However, the acquisition of a large number of high-quality annotated datasets consumes a lot of manpower, making it unfeasible in fields that require high levels of expertise (such as speech recognition, information extraction, medical images, etc.). Therefore, AL is gradually coming to receive the attention it is due.It is therefore natural to investigate whether AL can be used to reduce the cost of sample annotation while retaining the powerful learning capabilities of DL. As a result of such investigations, deep active learning (DeepAL) has emerged. Although research on this topic is quite abundant, there has not yet been a comprehensive survey of DeepAL-related works; accordingly, this article aims to fill this gap. We provide a formal classification method for the existing work, along with a comprehensive and systematic overview. In addition, we also analyze and summarize the development of DeepAL from an application perspective. Finally, we discuss the confusion and problems associated with DeepAL and provide some possible development directions.},

abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 48th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (ACM SIGIR 2025), taking place in Padova, Italy, from July 13th to July 18th, 2025.This year's conference continues its tradition of being the premier international forum for presenting cutting-edge research and showcasing innovative systems and techniques in the broad field of Information Retrieval.SIGIR 2025 is an in-person conference. We believe that holding the conference in person offers significant advantages, including richer opportunities for direct engagement and networking, a more dynamic exchange of research ideas, and a more welcoming environment for newcomers. To accommodate those who, in exceptional cases, are unable to attend in person, we have arranged for the option of proxy presenters (i.e. a qualified person presents on their behalf).This year's conference spans six days, beginning with a day dedicated to the Doctoral Consortium and Tutorial presentations. The following three days feature sessions comprising three Keynote Talks, full papers, short papers, resource and reproducibility papers, perspective papers, lowresources environments papers, system demonstrations, and an industry track (SIRIP). The program also features two Women in IR (WIR) activities (a panel and a poster session). Finally, the last day is devoted to Workshops aimed at fostering discussion and encouraging collaboration on emerging research topics in Information Retrieval, as well as to the LiveRag challenge, organized by the Technology Innovation Institute, and focused on Retrieval Augmented Generation. On Friday the 18th the ICTIR 2025 Conference takes place.Social highlights include a welcome reception, a conference dinner, a student luncheon and student party, as well as the WIR reception and the ICTIR Social Dinner.The SIGIR 2025 technical program is highlighted by three keynote presentations delivered by esteemed speakers, to whom we extend our sincere gratitude: Stephen Robertson (Girton College, Cambridge, UK), Iryna Gurevych (Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany), and Ophir Frieder (Georgetown University, Washington DC, USA).},

abstract = {Welcome one and all to the 19th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)!We are so pleased to re-welcome the HRI community to Boulder, Colorado, where HRI 2021 would have been held, had the COVID pandemic not interfered. Following up on the successful in-person conference held last year in Sweden, this year's theme is "HRI in the Real World," and focuses on advances that aim to bring human-robot interaction out of the lab and into everyday life.One aspect of this that we are very excited about is the introduction of a robot challenge to the conference activities, where teams from around the world will showcase their research and development via actual, interactive robots in the "real world" of an academic conference. It is our hope that this feature will grow and develop over the coming years into a staple of the HRI conference.This year's HRI conference saw an impressive surge in global interest, with 352 full paper submissions from around the world, marking a significant 40% increase compared to the previous year. These papers were categorized under relevant thematic subcommittees and underwent a double-blind review process, a rebuttal phase, and selective shepherding by the HRI program committee. From this process, 87 outstanding papers (24.7%) were chosen for full presentation at the conference. Reflecting our joint sponsorship with IEEE and ACM, all accepted papers will be accessible in the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore.},
